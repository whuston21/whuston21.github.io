    <h2>AUSTIN SUCKS</h2>
    <p> The 6-foot-5 forward scored 33 points in Saturday's win over Florida State. Colson's squad overcame a slide -- Notre Dame had lost five of six in ACC play -- with two consecutive wins. This is a Notre Dame squad with victories over Northwestern, Louisville, Syracuse and Florida State. The Fighting Irish can tussle with the best. And this season's tournament, like others in the past, will depend on matchups. Few teams will want to face Colson (16.7 PPG, 10.8 RPG, 1.5 BPG and 49.7 percent success rate in half-court sets, per Synergy Sports scouting data) and a fiery Notre Dame offense that leads the nation in free throw shooting (81.2 percent). Colson scored 33 points against an athletic, long Florida State frontcourt. How many times will he face an opponent in the NCAA tournament with similar attributes?
